    paragraph1: 'GEORISK Scientific Research Closed Joint Stock Company (GEORISK) is specialized in independent professional research, surveys, and consultations in the field of geology, geotechnical engineering, remote sensing, studies of mineral and water resources, assessment of natural hazards and risk, and environmental impacts and vulnerability of the infrastructure to climate change with application of advanced technologies. ',
    paragraph2: 'GEORISK was registered in the Republic of Armenia in 1998. Company structure includes departments  of geological mapping and geological hazards,  geophysics and engineering geology,  GIS and information technologies, and assessment of geo-environmental impacts. The staff of GEORISK includes senior researchers who have long-standing experience of active scientific research and a younger generation of experts, educated both in Armenia and in the European universities and research centers. In its multi-disciplinary activity, GEORISK  bases also on an extensive network of experts called on as required to support specific project needs and representing  government agencies, individual consultants, sub-contractor organizations as well as research institutes and universities. Moreover, the company has established  cooperation with many local and international partners, which enhances its capabilities in most of the undertaken assignments. ',
    paragraph3: 'GEORISK has worked mainly in Armenia, but has also experience of international assignments,  including  projects realized in Russia, Georgia, Iran, Egypt, Lithuania, Cyprus, Morocco, Syria, Sri Lanka and Kuwait. In Armenia and in other countries, experts of GEORISK has been assisting public and private sector organizations in the planning, procurement and implementation of a wide range of development projects and programs.',
    paragraph4: 'GEORISK has a proven track record of performing, supporting and rendering technical assistance to projects funded by the reputed international organizations such as the World Bank (WB), United Nations Development Program (UNDP), European Community (EC), International Science and Technology Center (ISTC), Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC). Company clients at the national level have been represented by the RA Ministries of Nature Protection, Science and Education, Urban Development, Energy, and Emergency Situations, as well as major companies active in the sectors of energy (Armenian Nuclear Power Plant, Contour-Global (Vorotan Hydropower Cascade)), mining («Zangezur Copper Molybdenum Combine», «Teghout» CJSC, «Dundee Precious Metals Kapan»), and private building and road construction companies. ',
    paragraph5: 'To resolve specific tasks in various fields of activity, GEORISK applies visual, instrumental, and computerized processing of remote sensing data collected by the satellite systems, as well as air photography of different types, geological, topographic and instrumental geophysical field surveys, and geotechnical and geochemical tests conducted in laboratory and in-situ according to national and international engineering standards and procedures. Implementing such complex assignments, the Company creates basic GIS layers, develops Digital Elevation Models (DEM), thematic GIS layers  and the structure of  related databases for the investigated terrain.',
    paragraph6: 'For many years, the staff of GEORISK has been performing studies of local soil  and seismic conditions and engineering assessments to support development of seismic micro-zoning  layouts for individual public and private areas, big cities and  communities in Armenia and abroad. The assessments and estimates of soil conditions delivered by the Company comply with the effective requirements of the Building Code of the RA and national and international testing standards.',
    paragraph7: 'One of important achievements of the Company is that during many years it has been accumulating information on the geology, geophysics, cartography and engineering geology for the entire area of Armenia and for some neighboring regions and storing it in digital databases. ',
    paragraph8: 'The most important assignments undertaken by GEORISK and their main results are represented under specific sections of the web site along with indication of the wide range of licensed professional software and advanced geotechnical and geophysical equipment enabling the staff to tackle complex tasks in the studied areas.

    main: `GEORISK offers its research capacities and expertise to undertake investigation of target archaeologial sites that may include assessment of soil conditions at archaeological conservation sites, detection and imaging of subsurface structure to support and direct the archaeological excavation, search and assessment of any traces of seismic impact that could have affected the extant historical and archaeological monuments, studies of structural-geological and seismotectonic conditions of the sites, resulting in the development of 3D digital model and database in GIS format for the area of the investigated sites. The basic geophysical investigation technique applied in  the archaeological study is  2D and 3D geo-radar survey. The most significant works performed by GEORISK in the field archaeo–seismology.`,

            `The studies were focused at the region around the 1st Pylon and the Memnon Colossi, in the eastern part of the Peristyle. 
            Numerous orthogonal cracks of extension were discovered at the site
            It was found that due to soil liquefaction, water-saturated sand penetrates into cracks and moves upward in the course of lateral spreading. Formation of such cracks leads to destruction of the structures
            The studies enabled us to record signs of many strong seismic impacts on the Temple of Amenhotep III with intensities not less than X (MSK 64). The date of the earthquake is established quite reliably after 1200 and before 900 BC. An earthquake of this size could not but destroy also the colossi at the First Pylon.
            Investigations  produced new evidence on the effects of a strong earthquake in the Temple of Amenhotep III and other temples in Ancient Thebes.`,

The last one involved mainly firm deposits, but, sometimes, it contained elements, which might be of interest for archaeology.
